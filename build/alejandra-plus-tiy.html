            <p>Most of my experience has been with companies just getting started; establishing dynamic design systems and style guides, and paving the way for semantic, modular code.</p>
            
            <p>Being the first designer on your product team would be a natural fit.</p>
            
            <hr />
            
            <h2 id="reputation">Reputation</h2>
            
            <h3 id="youre-cool">You're Cool</h3>
            <p>When my friends say something about an organization, I listen—and I've been hearing a lot of great things about The Iron Yard.</p>
            
            <h3 id="im-cool">I'm Cool</h3>
            <p>You should get a lot of good vibes from me, too! I'm resourceful and dedicated. I value humility before intelligence. I love collaborating, though I would describe myself as being a supermotivated self-starter.</p>
            
            <p>Don't take it from me, though: I've worked with a few awesome people that are already part of The Iron Yard team, so you'll have a bunch of first-hand accounts about what it's <em>really</em> like to work with me.</p>
            
            <hr />
            
            <h2 id="full-process-design">Full-Process Design</h2>
            <p>I am a generalist. A generalist is awesome when you're just starting to build a design team, working autonomously and sourcing specialized help when needed.</p>
            
            <p>I really enjoy being the first designer on a product, and love being able to give a brand a voice through my abilities. I recently read an article called <a href="http://fullprocessdesigner.com/">Full-Process Designer</a>. I very much identify with it.</p>
            
            <hr />
            
            <h2 id="values">Values</h2>
            <p>I think it's safe to say we share a lot of the same values:</p>
            
            <h3 id="education">Education</h3>
            <p>Lao Tsu once said:</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>“Whoever is stiff and inflexible is a disciple of death. Whoever is soft and yielding is a disciple of life. The hard and stiff will be broken. The soft and supple will prevail.”</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>I have what I think of as being an "amateur's mindset". I learn something new every day, and welcome new knowledge. Committing to the journey of learning is the key to vitality. An expert's mentality makes you inflexible; resistant to new knowledge or new ways of thinking.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>Being an amateur harnesses the Zen notion of “beginner’s mind” — a state of openness to possibility that closes up as we get calcified in expertise.</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>I'm a huge fan of Austin Kleon's writings, this quote especially!</p>
            
            <p>I am really invested in the code school/apprenticeship educational model. I'm always exploring different teaching methodologies, the psychology behind learning, and ways we can help improve these experiences.</p>
            
            <p>Additionally, since I'm always working with clients who may be new to the software devlopment process, I've found this kind of learning to be invaluable.</p>
            
            <h3 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h3>
            <p>This is a follow-up to my values regarding education. The software community is made up of smart, hard-working individuals. When people of various skill levels collaborate, amazing things happen, and everyone comes away a winner.</p>
            
            <h3 id="community">Community</h3>
            <p>It's important for me to be a <a href="https://medium.com/@alejandraluaces/we-don-t-need-more-negativity-bfaaaeb81073">positive force</a> in our community. I love The Iron Yard's inclusive, collaborative mentality, and that a core part of the curriculum is based around nurturing and leveraging community.</p>
            
            <h3 id="design">Design</h3>
            <p>When I'm working with a client, I keep things as low-fidelity as I can, for as long as I can. That way, we can allow the voice, tone, and visual style to evolve naturally before committing too much time to higher-fidelity assets. I read <a href="http://blog.theironyard.com/2015/07/20/nathan-spainhour-and-the-iron-yard-brand/">somewhere</a> that TIY values that type of process as well!</p>
            
            <p>It's important to establish a design foundation first: defining a strong, consistent message, and clear objectives. Visual design naturally follows.</p>
            
            <h3 id="gifs">Gifs</h3>
            <p>If you've read this far, congratulations! You shall be rewarded with a gif of some super cool cats:</p>
