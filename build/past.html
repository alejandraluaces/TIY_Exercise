            <h2 id="zookeeping">Zookeeping</h2>
            
            <p>Let’s take a step back for a second, before software. I tried my hand at getting a formal education through Santa Fe College’s Zoo Animal Technology program. There, I crammed thousands of scientific names into my head, did a lot of landscaping, and cleaned up a lot of poop.</p>
            
            <h3 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h3>
            
            <p>During collge, I learned a lot about learning. I noticed that in my zoo classes, I was able to retain and recall information with a much higher rate of success by practically applying what I learned immediately after I learned it.</p>
            
            <p>In math class, I spent weeks being lectured without any practical application, and would bomb the exams. No wonder.</p>
            
            <p>These experiences are what got me really caring about our broken education system, and how humans learn.</p>
            
            <hr />
            
            <h2 id="software">Software</h2>
            <p>I was feeling frustrated by my failed attempt at higher education, so I started seeking out learning opportunities in my community: attending bootstrapper breakfasts (even though I had no idea what that meant at the time), and the Tampa.rb meetup. There, I met Gavin Stark and Jason Perry, who told me about 8th Light's apprenticeship program.</p>
            
            <p>My web design career started when Cory Foy offered me a design apprenticeship with 8th Light. If you're reading this, Cory: thanks for taking a chance on me! &lt;3</p>
            
            <h3 id="th-light">8th Light</h3>
            <p>I spent nine months as Justin Herrick's apprentice in 8th Light's intensive design apprenticeship program in Tampa, Florida.</p>
            
            <p>My experience was pretty unique in that my mentor wasn't a designer, but a developer. This gave me a really unique insights into the development process and an analytical bent that I still possess to this day. My apprenticeship was also unique in that it was remote, which forced me to teach myself, using e-mail feedback and Skype hangouts to course-correct.</p>
            
            <p>The program itself covered design fundamentals, front-end development, and user experience research. I also planned and hosted 8th Light University events which took place weekly, featured a speaker, and ended with an open-office, collaborative working session.</p>
            
            <h3 id="freelancing">Freelancing</h3>
            <p>During my time freelancing, I worked mostly to establish brand kits for small, creative businesses and Etsy merchants.</p>
            
            <p>I also practiced photography and did a lot of technical cooking.</p>
            
            <hr />
            
            <h2 id="product-design">Product Design</h2>
            <p>I'm splitting my software career into two distinct sections because it was during this time that I developed a better sense of how I define myself as a designer and the niche I want to fill in this industry.</p>
            
            <p>I decided at this point that design needed to be a holistic process, with visual design, development, strategy, and copy, working together as one.</p>
            
            <figure>
              <img src="/images/field.jpg" />
              <figcaption>I worked on the pattern library and front-end development for The Field Museum.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            
            <h3 id="table-xi">Table XI</h3>
            <p>I came on as a Designer at Table XI and touched a variety of projects for a variety of clients: from early-stage startups to well-established organizations. I did work mostly for museums (like the Field Museum, see figure above) and nonprofits.</p>
            
            <p>I did print and poster design, chalk art installations, front-end development, illustration, and UX research. I helped establish the design kickoff process which was part of Table XI's 'Inception'. I also hosted Girl Develop It <em>Code &amp; Coffee</em> meetups, where I mentored some really lovely ladies.</p>
            
            <p>It was here I learned how to sell my designs, how to hold successful and informative design kickoffs, learned about SASS variable mapping, and about how to write <em>better</em> CSS.</p>
            
            <h3 id="eight-bit-studios">Eight Bit Studios</h3>
            
            <p>I am a product designer at Eight Bit Studios. I work on all design-related tasks: branding, copy writing, UX research, and front-end development.</p>
            
            <p>I still work for a variety of clients, including behemoth organizations like Nielsen and International Housewares Association all the way down to startups like Charipick (see figure).</p>
            
            <figure class="figure--small">
              <img src="/images/charipick.gif" />
              <figcaption>Charipick is an app that follows the dollar-a-day model.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            
            <p>Recently, I introduced the concept of design kickoffs. I'm proud to say they're now a part of Eight Bit's client onboarding process and help clients feel more involved in the outcome of our engagement. Designing in the open is also discussed in the design kickoff: if the client is receptive to the idea of documenting and publicly sharing the design and development process in a public-facing medium, it's added to their statement of work/contract. I'm responsible for writing the blog posts.</p>
            
            <p>My most significant achievement has been having an apprentice. I crafted a design apprenticeship syllabus complete with assignments, weekly reading, and a scheduled 1:1. I plan to open source the syllabus soon.</p>
